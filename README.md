# balancer-mono

## Changes made
* We've gathered all the necessary contracts in one a single repo (mutlicall, router, pool registry contracts). Previously, they were scattered around several different GitHub repos with no clear links between them, i.e. it was unclear what contracts are required, what versions were compatible, etc. Now everything is in complete synch and is deployment-ready.
* 
* We've added an ERC20 Wrapped Photon contract to support trading Photons
* We've re-written of on-chain balance retrival mechanism that relied on a custom multicall with no source code available. Balancer uses a custom multicall contract, which is not in Balancer's Github repo. This is a major show stopper for deployment of Balancer to Evmos. Our fork does not require this contract anymore.
